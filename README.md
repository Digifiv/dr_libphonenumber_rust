# dr_libphonenumber_rust

This library is the underlying implementation of [dr_libphonenumber](https://github.com/TabooSun/dr_libphonenumber).

The reason of having [DrLibPhonenumberAndroidBundler](DrLibPhonenumberAndroidBundler) is that Flutter Pub.dev is unable 
to store binary [securely](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/platform-integration/c-interop#closed-source-third-party-library). 
We therefore need to publish it to somewhere safe.
